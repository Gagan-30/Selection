# Selection

 Students need to score 40 in order to pass a test.
        int mark = 50;
        if (mark>40) {
            System.out.println("Passed");
        }
1) What is the output?
2) What happens if you change mark to 25?
3) What happens if they score 40? Make any necessary amendments.

Program 2: Students fail a test if they score 20 or below. 
1) Write a program that outputs a fail message.
2) Amend the program so that a pass message is displayed if they score more than 20.
 
Program 3: The pass mark boundaries for A Level Computing are A(320), B(280), C(240), D(200), E(160), U(0). 
Create a program that outputs the grade for the following scoresboundaries: 
1) 300
2) 50
3) 280

Program 4: Students sit two tests. The first test is out of 50 and the second 100. They are weighted and the average is calculated. The following pass boundaries apply: A(80), B(70), C(60), D(50), E(40), U(0).
Example:
test1 = 40
test2 = 75
test1Weighted = 80			 (i.e. test1*2)
average = 77.5				(i.e. (test1Weighted+test2)/2)
Grade: B
Create a program that outputs the grade for the following scores:
1) test1 = 15, test2=50
2) test1 = 34, test2=68
3) test1 = 48, test2=85
4) 
Program 5: Create a program that determines whether an inputted number is either odd or even.
